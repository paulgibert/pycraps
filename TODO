Dark side bets

Things I don't like:

The dualism of ActionBets vs StateBets

Breaking out table config as separate params (consider TableConfig object)
[Still debating] having to iterate over ActionBet fields when converting from/to numpy

to simplify the first implementation, if any illegal action is taken, the state is frozen and a small negative reward is returned. If training is too slow, introduce an action mask
